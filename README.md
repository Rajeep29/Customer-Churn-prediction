# 📊 Customer Churn Prediction

This repository contains a **machine learning project** that predicts whether a customer is likely to churn (leave) or stay with the company based on customer demographic and usage data. The project includes **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**, **preprocessing**, **model training**, and **evaluation** of multiple classification algorithms.

## 🔍 Project Overview

Customer churn is a critical metric for subscription-based businesses — identifying customers at high risk of leaving helps companies improve retention strategies and reduce revenue loss. This project uses multiple machine learning models to analyze patterns and predict churn outcomes.
